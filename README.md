# Responsive Company Web Page

## Overview

This project showcases a responsive web page designed for a company. The layout adapts dynamically to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. The page elements are fluid and adjust their sizes based on the window width, without fixed dimensions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The web page utilizes adaptive design principles, ensuring the layout responds to different screen sizes. Elements resize according to the viewport dimensions.
- **Breakpoints Handling**: The layout transitions smoothly through defined breakpoints:
  - On wide screens, elements are displayed in a 3-column layout.
  - On medium screens, the layout changes to 2 columns.
  - On narrow screens, elements stack into a single column.
- **Hover Effect**: Images on the page become lighter when hovered over, providing a subtle visual feedback to users.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and implementing the responsive design.
- **Flexbox**: To create flexible and efficient layouts.
- **Media Queries**: For handling different screen sizes and breakpoints.
